How to navigate the application:
In the file tab on the upper left, you'll be able to save and load your list to a text file. This text file can't be read by people, however.
In the edit tab right next to the file tab, you'll be able to add and delete entries on the list, as well as delete the entire list.
    When adding an entry, you'll be asked for the description of the entry (1-256 characters long) and a due date for the entry (optional).
    When deleting an entry, you'll only be asked which entry to delete.
    Upon clicking the "Delete List" button, the list is immediately cleared. 
In the lower portion of the screen, you'll see a table of entries. Each entry has a description, optional due date, and a checkbox showing whether the entry is complete
or not. 
To change the description, click on it and type in what you want the description to be (1-256 characters long). 
To change the due date, either type it in manuallyin the format YYYY-MM-DD or use the button to pull up a calendar, and select the due date from there. 
To change whether or not the entry is complete, simply tick or untick the checkbox.
